        Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.

        Java Platform
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Java Platform is a collection of programs that help programmers to develop and run Java programming applications efficiently. It includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries in it. It is a set of computer software and specifications. James Gosling developed the Java platform at Sun Microsystems, and the Oracle Corporation later acquired it.
        </li>
         <p>
        History of Java Programming Language
      </p>
        <li>
          The Java language was initially called OAK.
        </li>
        <li>
          Originally, it was developed for handling portable devices and set-top boxes. Oak was a massive failure.
        </li>
        <li>
         In 1995, Sun changed the name to “Java” and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning www (World Wide Web) development business.
        </li>
        <li>
          Later, in 2009, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took ownership of three key Sun software assets: Java, MySQL, and Solaris.

    <header>Why learn Java Programming</header>
    <article>
      <p>If programmers run the world, then Java programmers sit at the center of that power structure. If you plan to be a programmer, below are 3 reasons why you should start with Java.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          It's the most commonly used programming language in the world. It's a de facto standard. According to Oracle, 3 billion devices run on Java. 
        </li>
        <li>It's a good precursor to learning other programming languages (like C, C#, and C++). Java is a solid core language. Web and non-web environments, all operating systems, all types of devices; you’ll find Java everywhere.</li>
        <li>
          It's a mature language. Java is 22 years old (Java 1.0 was released in 1995). In other words, in the programming world, it's been around a long time.

      <li>
        Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
      </li>

      <li>
        Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.
      </li>
      <li>
        Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
      </li>
       <li>
        Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.
      </li>

    <header>First Program</header>
    <article>
      To create a simple Java program, you need to create a class that contains the main method:
      <code
        >class Simple{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
}  
      </code>
      Output:
     Hello Java

    <header>Constructors</header>
    <article>
      <p>
      A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have no explicit return type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, or to perform any other start-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.
    </p>
    <p>
      All classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to zero. However, once you define your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer used.
    </p>

    <header>Basic Operators</header>
    <article>
      <p>
      Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups:
      <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
        <li>Relational Operators</li>
        <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
        <li>Logical Operators</li>
        <li>Assignment Operators</li>
        <li>Misc Operators</li>
